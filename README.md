# Presentation-Scheduling-MobileApp
 
PresentPath is a mobile application that streamlines the tracking, evaluation, and scheduling of academic presentations and aims to correct the shortcomings and limitations in existing paper-based and disjointed communication methods that students and faculty members use to organize presentations. Conventional methods include paper-based planning and disjointed communication tools that result in scheduling clashes, delayed deadlines, and unorganized feedback. By providing automated scheduling and smart feedback functions through mobile devices, PresentPath optimizes the experience to be more user-friendly, efficient, and punctual. It has primary functions of User Profile Management, Presentation Scheduling Management, Marks and Feedback Management, and Student Performance Analysis that allow it to offer a robust platform to enhance the coordination and effectiveness of academic presentations. By providing students with feedback in real-time and personalized feedback, PresentPath facilitates students' learning and long-term academic development. By doing away with manual processing, PresentPath decreases administrative tasks and is a useful resource that institutions may utilize to enhance and streamline the presentation assessment process.
